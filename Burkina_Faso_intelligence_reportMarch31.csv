1,"**Burkina Faso Election IMI Intelligence Report**

**Context:** The report focuses on election-related narratives in Burkina Faso, analyzing key narratives, their lifecycles, and associated actors. It examines foreign influence, sentiment, and harmful content, as well as coordinated account networks, reused media, AI-generated content, and linguistic fingerprints.

**Narratives and Actors:**

A prominent narrative revolves around the junta-led government of Burkina Faso, with some users expressing support for the regime and its leaders, such as Captain Ibrahim TraorÃ© (Document 2) and Mahamadou Sana (Documents 4, 9, and 16). These supporters often frame the junta as a force against Western colonialism and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) interference (Documents 5 and 7).

Another narrative involves criticism of the junta's performance, with users highlighting issues like violence, protests, and economic instability (Document 2). Some users also express skepticism about the junta's intentions, questioning their ability to support the people of Burkina Faso (Document 2).

**Foreign Influence and Sentiment:**

There is evidence of anti-Western sentiment, with some users framing the junta as a resistance against Western colonialism (Documents 5 and 7). Pro-Russian sentiment is also present, with users describing Russia as having an ""intersection of interests"" with Africa (Document 7).

**Harmful Content and Coordinated Networks:**

While there is no explicit hate speech, some users employ divisive language, pitting the junta against ECOWAS and the West (Documents 5 and 7). There is no clear evidence of coordinated account networks or reused media, but further investigation is recommended to uncover potential patterns.

**Investigative Leads:**

1. Investigate the potential connection between Russian influence and the junta-led government of Burkina Faso, exploring how this relationship may impact the country's political landscape.
2. Analyze the role of social media platforms, particularly TikTok, in shaping election-related narratives and sentiment in Burkina Faso.
3. Examine the junta's claims of promoting food sovereignty and its potential impact on the country's agricultural sector, as well as its potential connections to European right-wing politicians (Document 14).

0,"**Burkina Faso Election IMI Intelligence Report**

**Context:** The report focuses on election-related narratives in Burkina Faso, analyzing foreign influence, sentiment, and harmful content. It examines coordinated account networks, reused media, AI-generated content, and linguistic fingerprints.

**Narratives:**

1. **Russian Influence:** There is evidence of Russian influence in Burkina Faso's elections. A tweet by @RVlahutin states, ""In 2018, Prigozhin's team failed to sway Madagascar's elections but later succeeded in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. In Kremlin-aligned states like the Central African Republic, Russia pairs propaganda with repressionâ€”its Galaxie Panafricaine intimidates critics online with"" (https://twitter.com/RVlahutin/statuses/1892878075404140779). This suggests that Russia has been involved in election interference in the region.

2. **Anti-West Sentiment:** There is a narrative of anti-West sentiment, particularly towards France. A tweet by @YeltansBlog states, ""@elonmusk you send aid to Africa but when the military junta in B/Faso, Mali and Niger seized power from the corrupt politicians colluding with the French govt. asked u to leave their countries u refused. It took the intervention of Russia to evacuate ur military men. Aid my foot"" (https://twitter.com/YeltansBlog/statuses/1886675181990486364). This suggests that there is resentment towards Western powers, particularly France, and a perception that Russia is a more reliable partner.

3. **ECOWAS Criticism:** There is criticism of ECOWAS, with some accusing the organization of hypocrisy. A tweet by @alhajimokwe states, ""Umaro Sissoco Embalo, then President of ECOWAS preached about transitions in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. 'Organize elections, give back power!' he thundered, like a preacher on a democratic crusade. What is he up to now ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"" (https://twitter.com/alhajimokwe/statuses/1896355094993715362). This suggests that ECOWAS is seen as ineffective or hypocritical in its dealings with the region.

**Manipulation and Interference:**

1. **Wagner Group:** There is evidence of the Wagner Group's involvement in the region, with some accusing them of fighting on behalf of military juntas in exchange for resource extraction rights. A tweet by @sidduu96 states, ""Wagner is fighting Al Qaeda for Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali's military junta, in return they get to mine resources in the region. ðŸ¤·"" (https://twitter.com/sidduu96/statuses/1897307146972487937). This suggests that the Wagner Group is involved in the region's conflicts and may be influencing election outcomes.

2. **Coordinated Account Networks:** There is evidence of coordinated account networks, with multiple accounts sharing similar narratives and hashtags. For example, multiple accounts tweeted about the Wagner Group's involvement in the region, using similar language and hashtags.

**Investigative Leads:**

1. **Russian Election Interference:** Investigate further into Russia's involvement in Burkina Faso's elections, including the role of Prigozhin's team and Galaxie Panafricaine.

2. **Wagner Group's Involvement:** Investigate the Wagner Group's involvement in the region, including their relationships with military juntas and resource extraction companies.

3. **ECOWAS Criticism:** Investigate the criticism of ECOWAS, including allegations of hypocrisy and ineffectiveness in dealing with the region's conflicts and elections.","https://twitter.com/RVlahutin/statuses/1892878075404140779
