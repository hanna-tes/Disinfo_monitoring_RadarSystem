the elections have just been postponed
to add the name of Laurent Gbagbo to the electoral list
after several days of intense manipulation
Alassane Ouattara has just announced as a matter
of urgency the postponement of the elections
and intends to select the voters list
to the name of Laurent Gbagbo
this surprise decision totally upsets the Ivorian political landscape
Gbagbo supporters cry victory for the people
and welcome 1 long- act of justice
while on the side of power
some speak of a political
to calm the growing social tension
in several cities across the country
crowds are already gathering to celebrate this new
the return of Gbagbo's name to the voters' list
holds out hope for a more inclusive election
and a true national reconciliation

I am at the salouata
I have solutions for you
yes my program of
government will take care of all Ivorians
without exception
Ivory Coast wants peace
My ambition is that you can bring
your contribution
to the development of our nation
haha
our proposals were refused
the big brokers imposed their prices
what do we have for them
asked from the moment they themselves
set a price that does not compensate the farmer's work
I remember when I was the first minister
of President Félix Soufoi-boigny
his dream was to reach
the figure of 1000 francs of of cocoa
and dear dad we made it
so you can be proud of us
when you look in all the countries of the world
great nations have been built
first from the peasant world
and to get there
we must not leave the farmers aside
it is necessary to accompany them with courageous reforms
I will make sure that there is
1 new case for cotton and natale
and the reforms that we
have recently undertaken in the agricultural sector
in reality
have enabled our sector
of exit from its lethargy of endon
it has indeed allowed to boost the productions
but also and especially
to be able to give remunerative prices to our producers
whether it is in the major export channels
and we have seen it recently with the prices of coffee and cocoa
cocoa well dried and well shouted
1 set atdeux-mille-huit-cents francs per kilogram
it is in all sectors that in reality
prices have increased to the producer
and it allows them to have the income
and it especially gives the incentive to these producers to
continue to work in the agricultural sector
to continue to improve their performance
so that when finished
it is the Ivorian consumer who has the choice of
agricultural products that are put to their
market availability
and at 1 slightest stroke
we will go further in food sovereignty
and for the earth to stay 1 chance for all
young women and rural communities
we will build 1 more inclusive agriculture
and more resilient
my dears
this is our ambition
1 great Ivory Coast that dares
that innovates and produces
1 great nation that brings together reassures and protects
I invite you to go out number of Saturday 25/10
to vote in peace
vote backwards so that together
we were building
1 great country I thank you",yes

As soon as the inspectors take the video,
they will analyze the video,
they will be able to find out where the video was produced,
where it was published.
So she can be geolocated,
it can only take longer,
but it can be found.
What she is doing here,
she is so confident to do so,
simply because it is no longer in Ivory Coast.
There is what is called metadata analysis and geolocation of media,
This is also called requisitioning from hosting platforms,
there is also called facial recognition and advanced video analysis.
If everything I just told you before doesn't work out,
there's this too.
There is also what is called social network surveillance

1 developed country takes example from other developed countries.

Here's Pepe driving into the area.
The pass into. Guess on just behind him.
The shot comes in and you just gonna just flex over the line.
No, it isn't.
Cleared off the line by the defender.
The ball still alive for the Ivorians. And then the chip shot
flies harmlessly wide.
First opportunity there for the elephants.
Pepe, who drove into the area.
The pass across just behind Gessel. Diallo
one on one, cuts inside.
Yala. Yala plays the ball across goal.
Lovely first touch there. And there's the opener.
And it's the captain, Frank Kessie.
Well, Amatiello making the run down the right,
cutting inside. Finding just the right pass there
as Kessie arrived at pace from midfield,
timing his run to perfection.
You can just see the run from Keshi.
And that first touch just takes him past the entire defensive line.
And the second touch slams it into the
nicely laid off opportunity here.
Oh, lovely first touch
and a brilliant save there from Modiambo.
More direct running this time from Kone.
Conner plays the 1 2.
Gael Deulofeu
going to ground there the halfway.
Diomande drops deep now. Drops a shoulder,
goes past one old jinks past another as well.
Diomande. Oh,
skips past the fourth player now as well.
Cuts inside.
Eventually the ball goes out for a corner.
Lovely change of pace there from Yan Zhao.
And wanders into the area as well.
Pepe curls it. In the header, just wide of the upright.
Evan Endecott
stealing in there,
the Roma centre back.
Now Gesso got Diallo on the right
outside in.
The flag stays down. Guess Diallo, though,
couldn't find the cross. That will be a.
Will it be a corner? No, it won't.
It's wonderful.
Diemond again putting on the after burners,
taking past two. Your side
flag stay down here. The keeper's out of position.
It's been slammed into the side netting by Nicholas Pepe.
That really should have been 2 nil.
بابا جی سیالکوٹ
lovely ball through after the run from d m O
and he had Amad Diallo waiting there unmarked in the cross
to deflect to the feet of Gesso
and now all of a sudden they're in behind again here Pepe
drives into the area
given away midfield again by the Haringey stars and now Pepe
finds a bit of space on this near side gets
away from the attempted foul
can't find the put the ball back gets the ball back
again second bite of the cherry for the number nineteen
lays it off to Diallo
Diallo goes to the top corner and that's just over the crossbar
the half the stadium thought that one was in.
As it caught the top of the net
Aquaro Klirs
do I chip it in towards guess on guess on lays it off
oh and again Kesia this time
skipping away from the challenge plays the ball into DMM on, DMM On now
crowded out, but there's a bit of a clip that coming in from Sissoko
and this freak
left footed might fancy that top left corner. But
Kone forced backwards. Oh,
lovely turn though by Kone.
Leaves his marker behind him.
Now Diomande uses his place,
goes past one, cuts inside Diomande.
Oh, fantastic goal from beyond Diomande.
And a goal that's richly deserved for the 18 year old.
Superb in the first half. And again as soon as he gets the ball in feet.
The Kenyan defence simply can't cope.
Picking up the ball here in the inside left position,
cutting past one and cutting inside
and just letting fly into the bottom corner. Beautiful finish.
Franck Yann Diemont now having started 4 days ago against Seychelles,
getting another start here.
Diemont
finds Conan running into space,
Conan trying to get in behind,
cuts the ball back and all. That was a
interesting attempt at the goal there from Evan. Get!
And the loose ball blazed over the bar.
I am at Diallo Cutting
now. Halle played in behind Halle
or is he taken down on the edge of the area?
Yes, as a referee.
Well, on the bright side for the former Dale.
And it is Diallo. Oh, great shot!
Questions may be about the keeper,
but I'm not. Diallo won't care.

They're in the central western part of the country
and one of the groups as I mentioned,
the Goro people who are within the Mandae,
the Southern Mandae, they're known for the zauli dance
this dance has actually gone quite famous and I can see why
it's quite beautiful. For instance,
it's has gone international fame.
It's music videos
such as by the artist Mia in the recently released movie sinners
and is now actually recognized as part of the UNESCO Heritage site.
Now at number four,
we have the crew people they make up roughly 9% of the population.
There's 3 million of them and a further 200,000 in Liberia.
They're in the southwestern part of the country
and according to one colonial source,
which you know might not be the most reliable,
but according to one colonial source,
apparently there were some of the fiercest resistors to
enslavement and colonialism.
They actually used to put a tattoo on their head
to distinguish themselves as free people.
Now at No. 2 or 3 depending on how you want to split the tie
there is the Northern Monday people.
They are less of a distinct group as well.
They're a cluster of different groups.
One of the larger groups,
groups within them being at the Mandinka people.
They make up roughly 22% of the population.
There's 7 million of them
but oh my gosh, there's also so many in other countries.
There's for instance at for the 4 million in Guinea,
2 million Mali and another 1 million in Senegal
and they're in the Northwestern part of the country
and out as I mentioned, one of the Northern Mandae groups,
this is the Medina
they used to have a large empire which was called the Mali Empire,
went from the 1200s to the 1600s
and its leader
Mansa Musa is considered to be the richest person ever actually,
which I find quite fascinating,
apparently being worth almost $400 billion.
Next we have the Gor people and again this is a cluster of groups,
the largest being the Sanuafo people.
It makes up roughly 22% of the population.
There's seven million of them
and also a further one million in the country of Mali.
They're in the northeastern part of the country and as I mentioned
the Senufo
so they are actually known for their quite intricate sculptures.
These sculptures have gone famous and quite beautiful.
The only thing I do hope though
is that at least some of that money actually goes back to
The Senufo people, and it's not just hogged by Westerners,
for instance, and at number one we have the Akahn people.
They make up 38% of the population.
There's 11 million of them,
plus a further 14 million in Ghana
where they make up actually roughly half the population there.
They're in the southwestern part of the country
and they're known for the Shanti Kingdom,
which actually fiercely resisted the British,
as well as actually having quite a large influence on the Jamaican
language, Jamaican English, Patwa.
So there you go. If you're one,
what if you're part of one of these groups,
please let me know in the comments down below.
I would like to hear what you think and please share and like.
Thank you.",yes
